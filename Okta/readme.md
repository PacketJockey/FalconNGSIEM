Okta Customer Threat Hunts and Detections from their own Customer Detections Repo located at https://github.com/okta/customer-detections.   

If you could test them and email john.smith@crowdstrike.com if you don't get the expected results.  A few of them I am still working on, you will see the queries listed as "PENDING".

Thanks!

Good Hunting!!!!
